Hello ((fullname)),

unfortunately the list of participants for ((event_title)) is already full. 
We therefor put you on the waiting list.

Should participants decide to withdraw their invitation, people from the waiting list
will automatically move up and will be informed via email.

Nevertheless it's a good idea to check the event website shortly before the event again
at {{url}}, if you maybe have moved up
on the participant list.

Your {{barcamp.name}} team!
