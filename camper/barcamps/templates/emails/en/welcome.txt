Hello {{user.fullname}},

{% if view.is_participant and not view.is_on_waiting_list %}
we confirm your participation of ((event_title)) at 
{{barcamp_name}}!

Should you for whatever reasons might not be able to make it to
the event it would be great if you could change your participant state
so we can plan better and to give other people a chance who might
be on the waiting list.

{% elif view.is_on_waiting_list %}
we are happy that you want to participate at {{barcamp.name}}.

Unfortunately all slots for ((event_title) are full right now 
but we moved you onto the waiting list. Should participants 
decide not to come or we might get more capacity, you will 
automatically move from the waiting list to the list of 
participants and we will inform you via email.

Nevertheless it's good habit to check the website at 

{{url_for("barcamps.index", slug = barcamp.slug, _full=True)}}

shortly before the event in order to make sure if you can come or not.

{% endif %}

The website for {{barcamp.name}} with all information can be found at 

{{url_for("barcamps.index", slug = barcamp.slug, _full=True)}}

{% if barcamp.twitter %}
Moreover we have a twitter at http://twitter.com/{{barcamp.twitter}} 
for all kinds of information around the event.
{% endif %}

Thank you for your interest in this event!

Your {{barcamp.name}} team!
